Legend:
- R/W (mode) <low> <high>
 [hook.txt]  0 = Shadow address ($00-ff, $0000-ffff)
 [hook.txt]  1 = Linear address ($000000-ffffff)

 (tracing must be activated first)
 [trace.txt] 2 = Shadow address ($00-ff, $0000-ffff)
 [trace.txt] 3 = Linear address ($000000-ffffff)

 Logging modes 4,5,6,7 will perform as 0-3 but will auto-enable tracing
 when the breakpoint is reached.


- PC <mode> <*> <*>
 [hook.txt]  0 = <low linear> <high linear>
 [hook.txt]  1 = <start linear> <stop linear>

 (tracing must be activated first)
 [trace.txt] 2 = <low linear> <high linear>
 [trace.txt] 3 = <start linear> <stop linear>

 Logging modes 4,5,6,7 will perform as 0-3 but will auto-enable tracing
 when the breakpoint is reached.


Tips:
1. You can turn on memory / instruction logging BEFORE you run the program

2. Toggle logging on/off several times to isolate just the piece of code you want

3. Using hook_pc* <start> -1 will blindly log data starting from your address.
   Useful for tracking math algorithms or hard-to-understand bugs.
